		If you have arrived at this page, it means I'm close to graduating! The commencement exercises for Landstown's Class of 2010 begin at 7pm, Friday, June 18th. (Probably today if you're reading this!) The purpose of this page is to direct you to the page where you can watch the broadcast LIVE online! And if you miss the live broadcast, this is also the page where you will be able to access the replay of the ceremony. So don't wait any longer!
