##### v0.6
- Fixed the index URL.

- Bracket output page will now display actual scores alongside the model.
- Converted CSV reads to SQL reads and added other pandas efficiences that cleaned up the code.

##### v0.5

##### v0.4
Added second app, "autobracket". It's basically a Python-replication of the Excel model we've been using in the office for a few years to generate brackets, with some added bells and whistles this year. Thanks to Kenpom for great data.

##### v0.1
Very first app, "haveyouseenx". Inspired by me constantly having to hear:

>"YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THAT MOVIE YET?"

(I'll get around to The Matrix...eventually.) :smirk: For now, it's just a list of all the video games I've ever played, but more functionality (including movies) will come.
